- `MYSQL_DATABASE` - Specifies the target schema for the API server and the default schema for the MySQL image.
- `MYSQL_ADDR` - Sets the address of the MySQL server to be used by the API server.
- `MYSQL_USER` - Specifies the MySQL user for both the API server and the MySQL image.
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` - Defines the MySQL password for both the API server and the MySQL image.

### API Server Configuration

- `APP_ADMIN_USER` - Sets the superuser account name for the `CUSTOMER` and `EMPLOYEE` tables.
- `APP_ADMIN_PASS` - Sets the superuser password for the `CUSTOMER` and `EMPLOYEE` tables.
- `APP_ENABLE_SU` - Enables the superuser accounts when set to `true`.
- `API_CLIENT_ORIGIN` - CORS origin of the web application.
- `API_SERVER_PORT` - Which port the API server should listen on.
- `APP_SSL_COMMON_NAME` - Sets the domain name for the SSL certificate generated during API server builds.

### Web App Configuration

- `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_ADDRESS` - Defines the base HTTP URL of the API server.

### Example `.env` File

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = <ROOT_PASS_HERE>
MYSQL_DATABASE = themepark_db
MYSQL_ADDR = 127.0.0.1
MYSQL_USER = <DB_USER_HERE>
MYSQL_PASSWORD = <DB_PASS_HERE>
APP_ADMIN_USER = root
APP_ADMIN_PASS = <SECURE_PASSWORD>
APP_ENABLE_SU = true
API_CLIENT_ORIGIN = http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_API_SERVER_ADDRESS = http://localhost:8080
API_SERVER_PORT = 8080
APP_SSL_COMMON_NAME = themepark.net

# Uncomment to enable https on the API server
# API_SERVER_ENV = production

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

The Theme Park Management System is our solution to manage data related to Seven Flags' operations. This all-in-one
website offers the ability for customers to purchase tickets and sign up for our exclusive events, as well as allowing
our wonderful employees to work with data pertaining to rides, ride maintenance, and events while providing detailed
reports on them.

#### User Roles and Data Management

- Customer: Can sign up for an account, purchase tickets, and sign up for events as well as view all the amentities
  Seven Flags has to offer.
- Employee: Can submit, modify, or delete maintenance requests and submit ride runs.
- Manager: Have the same priviledges as employees on top of the ability to view reports.
- Admin: Have the same priviledges as managers as well as the following capabilities:
    - Add, modify, and delete Customers and Employees information
    - Add, modify, and delete Rides
    - Add, modify, and delete Attractions
    - Add, modify, and delete Events

#### Queries/Reports

- Maintenance Status: A report of all maintenance requests that allows for filtering by ride name, ride category,
  maintenance ticket status, and the dates between which the ticket was submitted.
- Event Sales:
    - Summary: Report of the total sales from each Event.
    - Individual Sales: Report of each single sale that includes information on who purchased the pass and whether they
      have checked in for the event; allows for filtering by event name, and the dates between which the event pass was
      purchased.
- Ride Popularity:
    - Category Popularity Summary and Ride Popularity Summary: Reports that indicate how popular a ride is based on the
      occupancy versus capacity of the ride.
    - Individual Runs: Detailed log of each time a ride is operated on; allows for filtering by dates between which the
      rides were run.

## Semantic Constraints and Triggers

- Trigger 1:
    - If an event is canceled, all the customers who signed up for it get a notification saying that this event was unfortunately canceled. They are also unregistered from that event by default when the event is deleted. 
- Trigger 2:
    - If a ride is currently under maintenance, no ride operator can log it. All rides under maintenance are not removed from the dropdown for ride logging until they are fixed again.
- Semantic constraints
    - If an event is at maximum capacity, no customer can sign up for it until someone else cancels their registration.
    - Similarly, customers also cannot register for a ticket pass if the theme park is at maximum capacity for that particular pass.
